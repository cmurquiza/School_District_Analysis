#Summarized findings

##The results of this student analysis presents many findings. We compared analysis between subject scores, by grade and school type, the budget per school type, and by statistics by grade and school. 

##You can see that the top 3 schools that have the highest amounts of students enrolled are from Montgomery High School, Green High School, Dixon High School	and they are from Charter Schools. With this in mind, looking at the average school budgets and school budgets per school and school type, this can have an impact on student success.

## This was the results average school budget by school type:
School Type and School Budget 
Charter	872625.656236
Public	911195.558251

## Extra analysis was conducted to present the school budget by school name and school type:

## You can see the average charter school budget is $872,625.65 and for public school is $911,195.55. The difference in the average budgets are $38,569.90. You can also see how much each school actually received in their budgets and separated by school type, which allows you to see the differences in funding. Public Schools on average did have a higher budget, but how did that translate in math and reading scores?

10	66.443206	69.628822

11	59.314337	73.486448
12	63.568319	73.342380

## In the Charter schools, their Math Scores were a bit higher throughout all the grades, while in English it varied a bit in comparison to Public Schools. 

## Further analysis can be done to investigate which schools performed the highest and lowest in math and english. With those results, we can investigate the difference in teaching or what outside factors can be hindering other schools from excelling. 

## We can also investigate the income of these student's families based on if they have free/reduced lunch etc and see if there are socioeconomic barriers connected with these scores. 

##Lastly, taking a closer look at school size and the impact the budget has on its students could be further analyzed. With more money and fewer students, what is spent to help foster resources for the students? More money to be spent on highly educated teachers? More money for resources such as computers, libraries? With fewer students, are students able to receive more one-on-one attention? More data would need to be collected, but more can be done from here.
